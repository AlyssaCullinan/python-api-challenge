Module 6 Python API challenge. 

## Weekly Challenge for Module 6

This challenge was completed as part of the [Northwestern University Data Science and Visualization BootCamp](https://bootcamp.northwestern.edu/data/).

## Objective
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

### Methods Used
